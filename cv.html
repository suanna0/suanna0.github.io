                <h1>Artist Statement/CV</h1> 
                <p>
                    Suanna Zhong is a new media artist and computer scientist. 
                    Currently, she is pursuing a Bachelor's of Computer Science 
                    and Art degree with a minor in Animation at Carnegie Mellon 
                    University.
                    <br><br>
                    As a former Computer Science TA, much of Zhong's work is 
                    motivated by her desire for reform in Computer Science 
                    education—challenging its emphasis on prestige and 
                    reimagining the undergraduate pipeline that funnels students 
                    into the corporate world. By misappropriating 
                    well-established imagery from academic literature, her 
                    artwork not only serves as a catalyst for deconstructing the 
                    axioms that reinforce the power dynamics at play within 
                    academic institutions, but also represents the arduous yet 
                    meticulous labor of computer scientists within the context 
                    of contemporary art.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, Zhong’s work often reflects on what it was 
                    like to grow up during the golden age of Silicon Valley’s 
                    Web 2.0 optimism—while also navigating the complexities of 
                    queerness within that environment.
