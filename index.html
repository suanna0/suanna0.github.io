            <p class = "text">
            I am a junior at Carnegie Mellon studying Computer Science and Fine Art with a minor in Animation and Special Effects. <br><br>
            I believe that similar to identity, artistic practice is never static; my work is multidimensional, always evolving, and aims to capture the intersections of contemporary art and rapidly-changing technology. Some materials I work with combine CS and art such as 3D animation and creative coding, and some do not at all, such as photography, painting, and filmmaking. <br><br>
            The Computer is not my enemy. Do not tell me to paint French gardens when so much of my time is spent gazing at the Computer. <br><br>
            I come from a family of engineers. Hence, a lot of my work tells stories of my experiences growing up queer in an Asian household, my relationship to the Computer, and what my identity means in relation to pre-existing societal structures. I enjoy making work about my family as I find it interesting to compare and contrast how our struggles have changed over a generation, and what events have shaped our values. I also explore how queerness is more than someone's identity, it can be an ideology for an individual to live their life by. <br><br>
            Growing up, I saw my father, a mathematician, collect composition notebooks full of scratch work. It felt like magic, a language of intricate pictures I could not comprehend. As I took more math classes, I began to understand more of what exactly these mysterious symbols meant. As a Computer Science student myself, I have also accumulated many pieces of paper from solving math problems of my own. I see these as precious artifacts in my artistic practice. <br><br>
            Throughout my CS journey, I’ve found myself most drawn to problems that lend themselves to diagrams. In one of my classes, I had to implement a memory allocation library, a project done thousands of times before me. By the end of the assignment, I was left with pages of hasty arrows, numbers, and rectangles. At some point in time, these lines represented what was happening under the hood of my implementation to meet some goal. Now, the meaning of these drawings has faded from my memory. The drawings are evidence of my time and efforts spent towards something, though the end feels insignificant. <br><br>
