                    <!-- I am a new media artist and computer scientist.  -->
                    I am interested in exploring the intersections of technology 
                    and the arts, using my technical background to amplify 
                    creative voices through digital experiences. Currently, I 
                    am studying Computer Science and Fine Art with a minor in 
                    Animation and Special Effects at Carnegie Mellon University. 
                    My work has been commissioned by Meta/Facebook, Pinterest, 
                    Common Sense Media, and Dehancer.
                    <!-- <br><br>

                        The computer is not my enemy. 
                    </a>
                    As a former TA, teaching computer science to students from 
                    diverse backgrounds, I sincerely believe that CS education, 
                    as we know of it today, needs reform. My artwork 
                    misappropriates well-established imagery, acting as a 
                    catalyst for deconstructing the axioms that reinforce the 
                    power dynamics at play within academic institutions.
                    <br><br>
                   Additionally, coming from a family of engineers, much of my 
                   work tells stories of my experiences: growing up queer in an 
                   Asian household, my relationship to CS, and my identities in 
                   relation to social structures. I enjoy making work about my 
                   family as I find it interesting to compare and contrast how 
                   our struggles changed generationally, and the events that 
                   shaped our values. Also, I explore how queerness is more than 
                   someone’s identity—it can be an ideology for an individual to 
                   live their life by. -->
