          <p>
            In my junior year, I worked in the web development team for CMU's
            student run fashion club, Lunar Gala, which hosts the largest
            annual fashion event in Pennsylvania. The team's main deliverable
            is to create the website based on the 2025 theme,
            <a target="_blank" href="https://2025.lunargala.org/">Elysium</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content_images">
          <div class="video-container">
            <video preload = "none" autoplay muted playsinline loop>
              <source
                src="https://de1wwae7728z6.cloudfront.net/videos/elysium/elysium.mp4"
                                 type="video/mp4"
              />
            </video>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Process:</h2>
      <p>
        After receiving the theme pitch, our team first began with ideation.
        There are four sections of the show: Emergence, Blossom, Hubris, and
        Embrace. I was curious as to how to bring the narrative structure of
        the show into the website.
      </p>

      <div class="side_by_side_content">
        <div class="side_by_side">
          <img loading = "lazy"
            src="https://de1wwae7728z6.cloudfront.net/images/elysium/elysium_theme_pitch.jpg"
          />
        </div>

        <div class="side_by_side">
          <img loading = "lazy"
            src="https://de1wwae7728z6.cloudfront.net/images/elysium/elysium_figma.jpg"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        How can we combine elements of the natural world and man-made
        technology into a cohesive narrative? In my Figma Moodboard, I drew
        inspiration from nature photos, the Art Nouveau art movement, 90s
        anime, and sci-fi films. <br /><br />
        I noticed the similarities of the Elysium storyline and the
        sensibilities of the Art Nouveau movement which took place from the
        late 1800s until the start of World War I. During this movement,
        people had a sense of optimism with recent technology advancements.
        Artists combined elements of nature with man-made equations such as
        French Curves, which were originally created for the sake of
        mechanical linkages.
        <br><br>
        To bring these ideas to life without hindering the website's 
        performance, I used p5.js to create a dynamic background.

        The devil is in the details–gradient blur is not natively supported in 
        CSS. To create a frosted glass look that gradually changes in opacity 
        and blur-strength, we had to make use of some practical effects.

        In contrast to the sleek look of the main 
        page, the playful look of the archive acknowledges the number 
        of iterations that didn't make it to the final show–drawing from 
        Kaitlyn's and my shared experiences growing up as Asian American 
        women, we initially took inspiration from our vivid lexicon of 
        diasporic iconography.

        However, Lunar New Year is celebrated in countries beyond China–we

        students, highlighting their interpretations of the holiday. So, we
        turned the landing page into an open call, inviting Pan-Asian creators
        to design multiple landing pages. The following are the chosen artists'

      <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
      <p>
        I had been part of Lunar Gala Creative Team for two years; Photo
        Member in my freshman year and Head of Photography in my sophomore
        year. My main reason for switching to web team this year was to learn
        the best practices of making a website for a client from start from
        finish. Also, much of my coding experience at CMU so far has consisted
        of solo-projects to gain technical competency at a systems level, so I
        wanted an opportunity to collaborate with other developers to achieve
        a common goal. <br /><br />
        Also, as a third year student, I found the feedback from my peers to feel a
        bit redundant, which inspired me to seek critique from web developers
        outside of CMU–thank you,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanyan.ca/">Ryan Yan</a>! By doing
        so, I gained fresh perspectives and valuable insights. <br /><br />
        Furthermore, working on this project has taught me that the
        integration of art and technology must be thought out carefully. My
        experience in Computer Graphics offered insight as to what was
        computationally feasible and what was not, but through collaborating
        with designers, I learned that the Lunar Gala website should support
        the content, not "show-off" the power of the fanciest library out
        there. <br /><br />
        A successful website for a large organization such as LG should serve
        as a palette cleanser, not an experimental art piece. Coming from a
        fine arts background, I had to put my selfish ambitions aside, but I
        did not forget them; those ideas are precious seeds that will motivate
        future projects.
