            <p>
              In my junior year, I worked in the web development team for CMU's
              student run fashion club, Lunar Gala, which hosts the largest
              annual fashion event in Pennsylvania. The team's main deliverable
              is to create the website based on the 2025 theme,
              <a target="_blank" href="https://2025.lunargala.org/">Elysium</a>.

        </div>
        <h2>Process:</h2>
        <p>
          After receiving the theme pitch, our team first began with ideation.
          There are four sections of the show: Emergence, Blossom, Hubris, and
          Embrace. I was curious as to how to bring the narrative structure of
          the show into the website.
        </p>

            <img
              src="https://suanna0.github.io/images/tech/elysium_theme_pitch.jpg"
            />
          </div>

          <div class="side_by_side">

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          How can we combine elements of the natural world and man-made
          technology into a cohesive narrative? In my Figma Moodboard, I drew
          inspiration from nature photos, the Art Nouveau art movement, 90s
          anime, and sci-fi films. <br /><br />
          I noticed the similarities of the Elysium storyline and the
          sensibilities of the Art Nouveau movement which took place from the
          late 1800s until the start of World War I. During this movement,
          people had a sense of optimism with recent technology advancements.
          Artists combined elements of nature with man-made equations such as
          French Curves, which were originally created for the sake of
          mechanical linkages.

        <p>
          The devil is in the details–gradient blur is not natively supported in 
          CSS. To create a frosted glass look that gradually changes in opacity 
          and blur-strength, we had to make use of some practical effects.

        <h2>Archive:</h2>
        <p>
          This year,
          <a target="_blank" href="https://kaitlynng.com/">Kaitlyn Ng</a>
          and I worked on a new feature, an archive that showcases the other
          creative departments' work.
          <br /><br />
          A new feature on the site presented an exciting opportunity to
          reintegrate Chinese culture into Lunar Gala. The overstimulating noise
          of the typography serves as a vestige of the iterations that didn't
          make it to the final launch. Drawing from Kaitlyn's and my shared
          experiences growing up as queer Asian women in the Bay Area, we tapped
          into our vivid lexicon of Asian-American iconography—Chinese medicine,
          bustling Asian supermarkets, and nostalgic cartoons—to shape our
          vision.
          <br /><br />
          However, since Lunar New Year is celebrated in countries beyond China,
          we thought it would be more effective to uplift the voices of other
          students, highlighting their interpretations of the holiday. So, we
          turned the landing page into an open call, inviting Pan-Asian creators
          to design multiple landing pages.

          />
        </div>

        <p>
          Designing with modularity in mind, we aimed to ensure that future
          generations of LG can continue using the archive site to preserve
          their work. As the proverb goes, 'The predecessors plant the trees;
          the descendants enjoy the shade' (前人栽树，后人乘凉)—we see this
          archive as a foundation for future creatives to build upon. To support
          this, we decided to write instructions on how to add entries to the
          website.

        <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
        <p>
          I had been part of Lunar Gala Creative Team for two years; Photo
          Member in my freshman year and Head of Photography in my sophomore
          year. My main reason for switching to web team this year was to learn
          the best practices of making a website for a client from start from
          finish. Also, much of my coding experience at CMU so far has consisted
          of solo-projects to gain technical competency at a systems level, so I
          wanted an opportunity to collaborate with other developers to achieve
          a common goal. <br /><br />
          As a third year student, I found the feedback from my peers to feel a
          bit redundant, which inspired me to seek critique from web developers
          outside of CMU–thank you,
          <a target="_blank" href="https://ryanyan.ca/">Ryan Yan</a>! By doing
          so, I gained fresh perspectives and valuable insights. <br /><br />
          Furthermore, working on this project has taught me that the
          integration of art and technology must be thought out carefully. My
          experience in Computer Graphics offered insight as to what was
          computationally feasible and what was not, but through collaborating
          with designers, I learned that the Lunar Gala website should support
          the content, not "show-off" the power of the fanciest library out
          there. <br /><br />
          A successful website for a large organization such as LG should serve
          as a palette cleanser, not an experimental art piece. Coming from a
          fine-arts background, I had to put my selfish-ambitions aside, but I
          did not forget them; those ideas are precious seeds that will motivate
          future projects.
