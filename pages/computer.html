            <h1>My Dear Computer</h1>   
            
            <p class = "text">
            The computer is not my enemy. Do not tell me to paint French gardens when so much of my time is spent gazing at the computer. <br><br>

            Growing up, I saw my father, a mathematician, collect composition notebooks full of scratch work. It felt like magic, a language of intricate pictures I could not comprehend. As I took more math classes, I began to understand more of what exactly these mysterious symbols meant. As a Computer Science student myself, I have also accumulated many pieces of paper from solving math problems of my own. I see these as precious artifacts in my artistic practice. <br> <br>
                
            Throughout my CS journey, I've found myself most drawn to problems that lend themselves to diagrams. In a computer systems course, I had to implement a memory allocation library, a project done thousands of times before me. By the end of the assignment, I was left with pages of hasty arrows, numbers, and rectangles. At some point in time, these lines represented what was happening under the hood of my implementation to meet some goal. Now, the meaning of these drawings has faded from my memory. The drawings are evidence of my time and efforts spent towards something, though the end feels insignificant. <br> <br>

            Someone very close to me asked me what makes me angry. I told them that what I believe to be the three big evils in my life: imperialism, gender, and generational trauma. I thought that the computer married these three evils together; the computer was invented during war-time, CS is a male-dominated field, and many older members of my family work in tech. Following this, I told them that I thought love was the solution to these evils, and this love was best expressed through my artwork. Love extends infinitely and my emotionally charged compositions were a childish attempt at expressing it. I strictly made art without the computer; using large, bold marks felt faster than typing and debugging. The computer felt cold. She carried a heavy sensation of dread. <br><br>

            In my junior fall, I took one CS class, Computer Graphics, and ended up dropping it mid-semester. This was my first time experiencing college life without coding. I was oil painting non-stop but after a few weeks I felt limited by this medium. Each layer I do covers the previous one and it becomes unrecoverable. The computer is the opposite; code has the power to make objects mutable. Adding another degree of freedom opens up an uncountably infinite number of possibilities and deleting parameters can create whatever constraints I choose. <br><br>

            The limits of human perception is the enemy of innovation. That's not the case with the computer. I have been shown the computer against our own will but I still look for her when she's gone. The computer is inseparable from me. <br><br>
