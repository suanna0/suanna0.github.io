            <h1>My Dear Computer</h1>   
            
            <p class = "text">
            The computer is not my enemy. Do not tell me to paint French gardens when so much of my time is spent gazing at the computer. <br><br>

            Growing up, I saw my father, a mathematician, collect composition notebooks full of scratch work. It felt like magic, a language of intricate pictures I could not comprehend. As I took more math classes, I began to understand more of what exactly these mysterious symbols meant. As a Computer Science student myself, I have also accumulated many pieces of paper from solving math problems of my own. I see these as precious artifacts in my artistic practice. <br> <br>
                
            Throughout my CS journey, I've found myself most drawn to problems that lend themselves to diagrams. In a computer systems course, I had to implement a memory allocation library, a project done thousands of times before me. By the end of the assignment, I was left with pages of hasty arrows, numbers, and rectangles. At some point in time, these lines represented what was happening under the hood of my implementation to meet some goal. Now, the meaning of these drawings has faded from my memory. The drawings are evidence of my time and efforts spent towards something, though the end feels insignificant. <br> <br>
