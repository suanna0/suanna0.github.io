            <h1>My Dear Computer</h1>   
            
            <p class = "text">
                The computer is not my enemy. Do not tell me to paint French gardens when so much of my time is spent gazing at the computer.  <br><br>

                Growing up, I saw my father, a mathematician, collect composition notebooks full of scratch work. It felt like magic, a language of intricate pictures I could not comprehend. As I took more math classes, the true form of these once-mysterious symbols rose to the surface. As a Computer Science student myself, I have also accumulated many pieces of paper from solving math problems of my own, and these small drawings serve as precious artifacts in my artistic practice. <br><br>

                Throughout my CS journey, I've found myself most drawn to problems that lend themselves to diagrams. In a computer systems course, I had to implement a <a target = "_blank" href = "https://suannazhong.com/pages/tech/malloc.html">memory allocation library</a>, a project done thousands of times before me. By the end of the assignment, I was left with pages of hasty arrows, numbers, and rectangles. At some point in time, these lines represented what was happening under the hood of my implementation to meet some goal. Now, the meaning of these drawings has faded from my memory. The drawings are evidence of my time and efforts spent towards something, though the end product felt insignificant to me.  <br><br>

                Someone very close to me asked me what makes me angry. I told them that what I believe to be the three big evils in my life: imperialism, gender, and generational trauma. It felt easy to say as a coverall statement, that the computer married these three evils; the computer was invented during war-time, CS is a male-dominated field, and quite a few members of my family work in Big Tech. Following this statement, I told them that I thought love was the solution to these evils and that love was best expressed through my artwork. My emotionally charged compositions were a childish attempt at expressing it. I strictly made art without the computer; using large, bold marks felt faster than typing and debugging. <br><br>

                As technology further progresses, artists, including myself, place a special value on analog processes with tactile materials such as film photography, bookbinding, or in-camera practical effects. In my junior fall, I took one technical CS class, Computer Graphics, and ended up dropping it mid-semester. This was my first time experiencing college without any programming assignments. I filled up the free time with oil painting but after a few weeks, I began to miss the computer. This time away from coding taught me a very valuable lesson: the integration of computers with other mediums must be well-thought out. There are <a target = "_blank" href = "https://youtu.be/BKyWvce2yAY?feature=shared&t=1195">infinite permutations</a> of combining art and CS, and whether its web development, knitting, creative coding, time-based media, or translating computer processes into analog form with my paintings. My experience in CS offered insight as to what was computationally feasible and what was not, but through working on small projects outside of SCS, I learned that the interdisciplinary computer art should work in conjunction with other mediums, not "show-off" the power of the computer.<br><br>

                I have been shown the computer against my own will but <a target = "_blank" href = "tech/diagram.html">I still look for her when she's gone</a>. <br><br>
