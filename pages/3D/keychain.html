                Process: <br><br>
                I drew inspiration from collectible toys such as Smiskis, Miffy, and Astro Boy. To avoid over-complicating the form, I looked for ways to communicate a human form with as few shapes as possible. I studied the proportions of various figurines and I noticed that a big head, small torso, and large torso, tended to be successful.

                Rigging–The goal of rigging was to create some muscle systems along the form as if the mask had a life of its own. However, this did not end up being necessary in the final render since the dancer moved a lot and the viewer would not be able to notice subtle changes in the mask's shape.

            <p class = "text"> Rendering–During filming, we mapped the nodes onto the dancer's face that corresponded with the nodes in the mask. Instead of mapping one-to-one in every frame in the video, I decided to render every other frame to emphasize the artificial quality of the mask.
