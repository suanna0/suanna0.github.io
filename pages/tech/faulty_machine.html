                            The Church-Turing Thesis (CTT) states that any computation that can be conducted in this universe (constrained by the laws of physics of course), can be carried out by a TM.

                        <li>
                            The term algorithm is synonymous to computer (and machine) and makes it more clear that we are not necessarily talking about a physical device.

                My Faulty Machine is a book that illustrates introductory concepts in 15251: Theoretical Computer Science. The goal of this project is to clarify technological terms in a friendly way, furthering my journey to demystify the computer.

                        In this case, the computation is explaining vocabulary to someone who is unfamiliar with Computer Science. By CTT, there exists some TM that can replicate this task.

                        If an algorithm is a mathematical representation of a computer, I claim that this book, a tangible artifact that takes up physical space, is a computer. In fact, the computer does not always have to be a machine that speeds up processes. While I have a very fond appreciation for the process of compilation at the low-level, I am also interested in the laborious nature of handmade processes. These projects force me to slow down by interacting with the physicality of the medium I work with.

                As part of my goal to subvert the power the computer can have over me, I choose to view her as a bold, assertive, feminine figure. To embody that feeling, I used hot pink as an accent color in the branding.

                Embodying the concept of "demystifying" the computer, I experimented with various types of transparent papers such as tracing paper, acetate, and translucent yupo. Yupo was the perfect choice–its smooth texture and its thickness could withstand the tension of being bound by thread.
