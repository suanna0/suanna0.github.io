                Malloc is a lab assigned in the CMU course, 15213: Introduction to Computer Systems. After the lab, the students gain a deeper understanding of malloc at a systems level, fluency in pointer arithmetic, and practice writing performance-critical and bug-free systems code. <br><br>
                During the lab, I saw an opportunity to make improvements that could help students learn the abstract concepts through visual diagrams.

            <p class = "text">
                Students are encouraged to write modular code to help create flexible changes in the future and I wanted the design to reflect that. Hence, I drew inspiration from Swiss Design principles such as enforcing a modular grid system and minimal elements.

                How can we combine elements of the natural world and man-made technology into a cohesive narrative? In my Figma Moodboard, I drew inspiration from nature photos, the Art Nouveau art movement, 90s anime, and sci-fi films. <br><br>
                I noticed the similarities of the Elysium storyline and the sensibilities of the Art Nouveau movement which took place from the late 1800s until the start of World War I. During this movement, people had a sense of optimism with recent technology advancements. Artists combined elements of nature with man-made equations such as French Curves, which were originally created for the sake of mechanical linkages.

                I experimented with bezier curves and circular arcs to create elegant stems, and sinusoidal movement to mimic how tree branches sway in the breeze.

            <h2>Site Interaction:</h2>

            <p class = "text">
                Our team nailed down site interaction to ensure a comfortable interface for the user before finalizing visual elements. We explored the idea of using a preloader as the hero element. The preloader would display a radial timeline to represent the four acts and be completely separate from other pages of the show. This way, the hero element of the site does not distract from other information we wanted to present.

            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
            <p class = "text"> 
                I had been part of Lunar Gala Creative Team for two years; Photo Member in my freshman year and Head of Photography in my sophomore year. My main reason for switching to web was to learn the best practices of making a website from start from finish. Also, much of my coding experience in school has been doing solo-projects to gain technical skills, so I wanted an opportunity to collaborate with other developers.
