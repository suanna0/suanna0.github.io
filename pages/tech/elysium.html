                Web Development, 2024-2025. <br><br>
                In my junior year, I worked in the web development team for CMU's student run fashion club, Lunar Gala, which hosts the largest annual fashion event in Pennsylvania. The team's main deliverable is to create the website based on the 2025 theme, Elysium. <br><br>
                Process: <br><br>
                After receiving the theme pitch, our team first began with ideation. There are four sections of the show; Emergence, Blossom, Hubris, and Embrace. I was curious as to how to bring the narrative structure of the show into the website.

                How can we combine elements of the natural world and man-made technology into a cohesive narrative? In my Figma Moodboard, I drew inspiration from nature photos, the art noveau art movement, 90s anime, and sci-fi films.

                I had been part of Lunar Gala Creative Team for two years; Photo Member in my freshman year and Head of Photography in my sophomore year. My main reason for switching to web was to learn the best practices of making a website from start from finish. Also, much of my coding experience in school has been doing solo-projects to gain technical skills, so I wanted an opportunity to collaborate with other developers.
