                <h2>The Problem:</h2>
                <p>
                    In my junior year, I participated in my first group exhibition, Irish Exit, located in the Frame Gallery. This was one of my first times installing my work in a gallery space and I struggled a lot in the days leading up to the show. It took much trial and error: I had to remeasure, remove nails, and patch up and paint over any holes I created to ensure a clean look for the opening reception.<br><br>
                    To expedite the process for artists, we created FrameCAD, an immersive online tool where student artists can test out arranging their art in the Frame Gallery.

                <h2>Site Interaction:</h2>
                <p>
                    Our team nailed down site interaction to ensure a comfortable interface for the user before finalizing visual elements. We explored the idea of using a preloader as the hero element. The preloader would display a radial timeline to represent the four acts and be completely separate from other pages of the show. This way, the hero element of the site does not distract from other information we wanted to present.

                <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                <p> 
                    I had been part of Lunar Gala Creative Team for two years; Photo Member in my freshman year and Head of Photography in my sophomore year. My main reason for switching to web was to learn the best practices of making a website from start from finish. Also, much of my coding experience in school has been doing solo-projects to gain technical skills, so I wanted an opportunity to collaborate with other developers.
