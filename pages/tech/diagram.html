            <p class = "text">
                Diagram Appropriation is my index. It shows how my debugging sketches have informed my artistic practice.<br><br>

            <h2>Process:</h2>
            <p class = "text">
                I was inspired by the natural shapes created by my Deterministic Finite Automaton diagrams. To make a more elegant image, I drew inspiration from Mark Lombardi's diagrams and I tried to look for ways I could change the relationship between the nodes and the edges.
            </p>

            <p class = "text">
                Looking through loose papers, I noticed that a majority of them were done with pencil or pen. I wanted to make sure that the interface did not distract from the content, so I decided to keep it simple with black text on a white background with minimal node movement. Here is a rough prototype on Figma before I began implementating with code.

            <h2>Graph Movement:</h2>
            <p class = "text">
                Since the project is 2D, it made the most sense to use p5.js for my implementation. To create my graph, I started with working <a target ="_blank" href="https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/-XAvixBhM">spring code</a> created by Golan Levin. Mimicking my early sketches, I opted for bezier curves instead of straight lines to connect the nodes.

                <img id = "content_img" alt="p5" src="https://suanna0.github.io/images/tech/diagram_p5_test.gif">
            </div>

            <p class = "text">
                I asked a few people to test the site interaction. A common piece of feedback I got was that the recoil of the springs was too fast and it was too difficult to see the topology of the graph. One person said that the oval nodes looked confusing so I decided to change the node shape to tiny A4 papers. While the rectangular nodes might not have the same, organic, quality as my sketches, it feels more intuitive to the user that the nodes represent pieces of paper.

            <h2>Storing the Data:</h2>
            <p class = "text">
                Not all edges hold the same meaning. Some pages had scratch work for multiple classes and I needed a way to distinguish between different courses. Hence, I used an adjacency matrix to store the edge information. Instead of populating the matrix with 1's to represent a non-zero value, I used the course number. As for the nodes, I used an array so that the information could be accessed with basic iteration.
