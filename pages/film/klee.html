                    “One of the persistent images of San Francisco Bay Area 
                    Architecture [is] the natural house taking its place 
                    unpretentiously in the environment…the 'immensity of the 
                    scene,' militiated against the house as a highly polished 
                    object set against a backdrop.” –Woodbridge Sally B. Bay 
                    Area Houses (1976) <br><br>
                    In my critical studies class, we were asked to write about a 
                    monument. My mind wandered to estate-turned museums in 
                    secluded wilderness: Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, 
                    Hearst Castle in San Simeon, and Filoli in Woodside.
                    As a teenager, my dad and I would take long drives down the 
                    California Coast, visiting these landmarks. As a result, I 
                    began constructing a taste for what the dream home I hoped 
                    to live in one-day may look like. This notion of a dream 
                    home that works in conjunction with the landscape, that is 
                    then transformed into a monument/source of tourism function
                    as a display of wealth, a time capsule into what it was like 
                    to be part of the socialite class in that time period.
                    <br><br>
                    This fascination with estates-turned-monuments led me to 
                    question the role of architecture in realizing our fantasies.
                    Perhaps we can perfect our environment until we can no 
                    longer feel pain. KLEE, a fictional interior design 
                    service, explores how the home, meant to be a place of 
                    comfort, can also serve as a site for superficial 
                    performance.

                <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
                <p>
                    John's dimly lit bedroom, cluttered with a gamer chair and 
                    pizza boxes, sets the stage for an awkward morning 
                    after—sending his date, Jane, fleeing in horror. Realizing 
                    his living space might need some serious work, John finds 
                    himself doom-scrolling Pinterest for inspiration. Enter 
                    Sally, a sharp-witted interior designer who provides him 
                    with a vision (and a price tag) to bring his home to life.
                    <br><br>
                    With a checklist in hand and a package of design ideas, John 
                    enlists his friends to help revamp his space, piece by 
                    piece. A pickup truck full of furniture and some teamwork 
                    later, his once-disastrous apartment is unrecognizable. As 
                    the final touch, everyone—including Jane and Sally—
                    celebrates the transformation with an all-out dance party to 
                    Got Me Started, proving that sometimes, a new couch can 
                    change everything.

                <p>
                    It's been wonderful working with 
                    <a target = "_blank" href = "https://leslie-lin.com/">Leslie Lin</a> 
                    to make this idea come to life. For production design, I 
                    helped with photo assets, compiling a mixture of styles I 
                    saw in Pittsburgh and San Francisco.
