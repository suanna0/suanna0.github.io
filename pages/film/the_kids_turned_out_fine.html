                Dexter Navy is a filmmaker and photographer from London. His works have a distinct psychedelic look, and  a rough and authentic feel. He is best known for directing A$AP Rocky‚Äôs ‚ÄúLSD‚Äù music video, which was nominated for Best Music Video at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards. <br><br>
                Inspired by A$AP Rocky's Kids Turned Out Fine music video, I created a 35 second looping visual. Growing up in the Silicon Valley, I always felt pressured to prioritize academics instead of enjoying the last few years of my youth. Although teenagers are generally discouraged from trying inappropriate things, their parents most likely made the same mistakes in their teen years and in the end, they still ‚Äúturned out fine.‚Äù <br><br>
